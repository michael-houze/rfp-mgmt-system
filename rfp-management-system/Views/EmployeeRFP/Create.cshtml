<h1>This is the RFP Creation page</h1><br />

<h3>Page synopsis</h3>
<p>
    This is the page the employee will use to create a new RFP. This page will list all
    of the fields that need to be filled out in order to create an RFP.  Validation will exist on each
    filed to ensure there are no data issues.  When the 'Create' link is selected, the RFP will be added
    to the system.  There will also be a 'Return to RFP Management' link.
</p>

<br />

<p>From here, there are 2 possibilities:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The user creates an RFP and is sent back to RFP management</li>
    <li>The user does not create an RFP and returns to RFP management</li>
</ul>

<br />

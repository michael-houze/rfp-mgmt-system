<h1>Respond to Selected Contract</h1><br />

<h3>Page synopsis</h3>
<p>
    This is the page the vendor will use to respond to a selected contract.  This screen will list all of
    the information regarding the contract and will provide inputs to upload the required documents. The
    vendor will be returned to the vendor contract dashboard upon completing the form.
</p>

<br />

<p>From here, there are 2 possibilities:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The vendor responds to the contract and is returned to the contract dashboard</li>
    <li>The vendor does not respond to the contract and returns to the contract dashboard</li>
</ul>

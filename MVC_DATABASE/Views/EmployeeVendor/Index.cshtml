<h1>This is the Vendor Management page</h1><br />

<h3>Page synopsis</h3>
<p>
    This is the page the employee will use to select a vendor they want to make changes to.
    They will be able to update all of the basic information (such as address, contact info)
    as well as change their status (pending, qualified, disqualified) and to approve them for
    different product categories.  This page will be the same for both employee and admin users.
    This page will provide a list of existing vendors with an 'Update' link next to each one.
    There will be a 'Return to Dashboard' link at the top.
</p>

<br />

<p>From here, there are 3 possibilities:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The employee selects a vendor to update and gets sent to a page listing that vendor information.</li>
    <li>The user is an admin and returns to their dashboard</li>
    <li>The user is an employee and returns to their dashboard</li>
</ul>

<br />

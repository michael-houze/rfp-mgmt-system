<h1>This is the Employee Creation page</h1><br />

<h3>Page synopsis</h3>
<p>
    This is the page the admin will use to create a new employee. This page will list all
    of the fields that need to be filled out in order to create an employee user.  Validation will exist on each
    filed to ensure there are no data issues.  When the 'Create' link is selected, the employee will be added
    to the system.  There will also be a 'Return to Employee Maintanence' link.
</p>

<br />

<p>From here, there are 2 possibilities:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The user creates an Employee and is sent back to Employee maintanence</li>
    <li>The user does not create an Employee and is sent back to Employee maintanence</li>
</ul>

<br />

<h3>Links</h3>
@Html.ActionLink("Return to Employee Maintanence", "Index", "AdminEmployee")<br />
